        <h6><span class="bold">Sorcerer's Void</span> is a third-person action RPG inspired by iconic Souls-like titles such as <span class="italic">Elden Ring, Black Myth: Wukong,</span> and <span class="italic">Lies of P.</span> This game was developed using Unreal Engine as part of a Senior Capstone Project at the University of Nevada, Reno, in collaboration with two other team members. Staying true to the Souls-like genre, <span class="bold">Sorcerer's Void</span> incorporates key features such as fluid player controls, unique enemies, a progression system, and immersive storytelling.
            <br><br>
            As a team of three guys who grew up playing video games, our goal was to create a game we could proudly showcase to faculty, friends, family, and potential employers. We chose the Souls-like genre because it demands a careful balance between fun and challenge, a critical factor in the success of these games. Achieving this balance demonstrates a solid understanding of what it takes to craft an engaging and rewarding gaming experience.
